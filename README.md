# EMSI Job Change Dataset Project 📊

## Overview ℹ️
Welcome to the EMSI Job Change Dataset Project! This project aims to analyze job change data using the EMSI dataset. We explore employment trends across industries and cities, providing valuable insights into the changing job landscape.

## Data Preparation 🛠️
The project begins with data cleaning tasks performed in Microsoft Excel. The dataset is carefully cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Excel serves as our tool for data manipulation and preparation before being imported into Tableau for visualization.

## Visualizations in Tableau 📈
The cleaned dataset is then imported into Tableau to create insightful visualizations. Tableau allows us to visualize trends and patterns in the data through interactive and visually appealing dashboards.

## Visuals Created 🎨
We have created four main visualizations using Tableau:

1. **Top 5 Industries by Employment**: Explore the top industries by employment, providing insights into the sectors with the highest job opportunities.

2. **Percentage of Change of City**: Analyze the percentage change of employment in different cities, highlighting areas experiencing significant job growth or decline.

3. **Top 5 Employment Change based on SIC code In UK**: Visualize the top 5 employment changes based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes in the UK, revealing shifts in industry sectors.

4. **Bottom 5 Sub-industries in Employment**: Discover the bottom 5 sub-industries in employment, uncovering sectors with the lowest job opportunities.

## Usage 🚀
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SathiyavathiR/EMSI-job-Change-UK.git
   
Explore the cleaned dataset in Excel to understand the data structure and preparation process.

Import the cleaned dataset into Tableau and explore the provided Tableau workbooks for detailed visualizations.
